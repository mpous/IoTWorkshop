This is an example of posting data from Arduino shield to Cosm.

I posted data from light sensor and temperature from Arduino + Ethernet Shield to Cosm. Depending on the reply orf the server a green or red led blinked to tell to the user that everything went good/bad.

This is the picture of the Arduino shield with the sensors [http://www.flickr.com/photos/23124942@N03/7521441354/in/photostream/] by @tamberg

If anyone wants to adapt it introduce your Cosm key.

This code was done during the IoT Workshop @ Zurich 7/7/2012.
