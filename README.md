These are the prototypes developed during the IoT Workshop @ Zurich 7/7/2012

* Light Temperature with Arduino and Ethernet Shield

The photoSensorLedEthernetShield.ino captures the light from photo sensor and temperature sensor connected at the Ethernet shield with Arduino.

* Cosm Light Temperature CSV

The cosm_light_temp_csv.ino posts data from light sensor and temperature from Arduino + Ethernet Shield to Cosm. Depending on the reply orf the server a green or red led blinked to tell to the user that everything went good/bad.

ALERT: If anyone wants to adapt it introduce your Cosm key.
